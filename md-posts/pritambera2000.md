## What is Climate change?
Climate is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area. People often confuse weather and climate; the difference is really a matter of time. Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

  > “Climate change is real. It is happening right now, it is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.”  --Leonardo Di Caprio, Actor & Environmentalist

## Causes of climate change
There are many reasons of climate change but Scientists telling that the recent climate change is largely caused by human activities. Here are some key point-
- **Deforestation** , because living trees absorb and store carbon dioxide
- **Increasingly intensive agriculture**  which emits greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide
- **Fluorinated gases** are emitted from equipment and products that use these gases. Such emissions have a very strong warming effect, up to 23 000 times greater than CO2.

- **Greenhouse gases** and the greenhouse effect – Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and stop it escaping into space. We call these 'greenhouse gases'. These gases act as a warming blanket around the Earth, known as the 'greenhouse effect'. Greenhouse gases come from both human and natural sources. Gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide naturally occur in the atmosphere. Others, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are only produced by human activity.

## What is the issue?
Humans and wild animals face new challenges for survival because of climate change. More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals, destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people’s livelihoods and communities

- Effects on species  Almost every species facing direct and indirect bad effects of climate change. But some  Atlantic  species are highly endengered because of climate change especially global Warming
  - **Polar Bear** The Arctic warming about twice as fast as the global average, causing the ice that polar bears  depend on to melt away.Loss of sea ice, polar bears are forced to stay longer on land.This is increasingly bringing them into contact with local people in Antarctic villages and towns , leading to bears and people being injured or killed in self defense.

  - **Atlantic Puffins** These beautiful little birds can be seen in various locations around the UK each summer - they migrate here to breed.  But as climate change causes changes to the start and end of seasons, migrating animals can find that they arrive at breeding grounds at the wrong time - before food is available, for example.  And the prey that seabirds rely on to feed their chicks is moving as seas warm, as well as being overfished. All of these are adding up and causing numbers of puffins to fall sharply.
  
  - **Snow leopards** Warming in the Himalayas has already occurred at three times the global average. This is prime snow leopard habitat and continued warming will cause their range to shrink as the treeline moves higher up the mountains. This will not only fragment and isolate snow leopard populations, but it will severely affect their prey too.
 
  - **Adelie Penguins** In parts of the Antarctic peninsula, sea ice cover has reduced by over 60% in 30 years. One of the Adélies’ main food sources, krill, needs sea ice to breed and feed under, and the loss of ice is thought to be causing a decline in krill in some areas. Warmer temperatures can also affect Adélie chick hatching times, and they may hatch at times when food is more scarce.

- **Effects on humans** The vulnerability and exposure of humans to climate change varies from one economic sector to another and will have different impacts in different countries. Wealthy industrialized countries, which have emitted the most CO2, have more resources and so are the least vulnerable to global warming. Economic sectors that are likely to be affected include agriculture, human health, fisheries, forestry, energy, insurance, financial services, tourism, and recreation. The quality and quantity of freshwater will likely be affected almost everywhere. Some people may be particularly at risk from climate change, such as the poor, young children and the elderly.According to the World Health Organization, between 2030 and 2050, "climate change is expected to cause about 250,000 additional deaths per year. As global temperatures increase, so does the number of heat stress, heatstroke, and cardiovascular and kidney disease deaths and illnesses.Air pollution generated by fossil fuel combustion is both a major driver of global warming and – in parallel and for comparison – the cause of a large number of annual deaths with some estimates as high as 8.7 million[dubious – discuss] excess deaths during 2018. It may be difficult to predict or attribute deaths to anthropogenic global warming or its particular drivers as many effects – such as possibly contributing to human conflict and socioeconomic disruptions – and their mortality impacts could be highly indirect or hard to evaluate. 

## What can we do?

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to stopping or slowing climate change, and each individual, business, municipal, state, tribal, and federal entity must weigh their options in light of their own unique set of circumstances. Experts say it is likely many strategies working together will be needed. Generally speaking, here are some examples of mitigation strategies we can use to slow or stop the human-caused global warming  

1. **Be More Conservative with Energy Usage**  Where affordable, we can conserve energy by better insulating our homes and buildings, and by replacing old, failing appliances with more energy-efficient models.we can drive electric vehicles instead of those that burn fossil fuels; or we can use mass transit instead of driving our own cars.
2. **Make your voice**  One of the best ways to improve climate change to is to help those who will fight against it get into office. This means voting for legislation and politicians that aid against the detrimental effects of climate change.
   >"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything."  --Albert Einstein 
3. **Recycle** Manufacturing plants emit a large number of greenhouse gasses per year. It is unavoidable in the production of goods that we use on a regular basis. However, a cleaner alternative would be to invest in recycling. Recycling is a cost-effective and eco-friendly process that eliminates waste and doesn’t emit greenhouse gasses into the environment.
4.  **Educate Yourself and Others** The importance of educating others about climate change cannot be overstated in our modern society. There are many platforms for us to utilize that can allow us to spread our message easily. Whether you use word of mouth or social media, there are always ways to educate others on what climate change is doing to our planet. You can help protect the planet by educating others about the dangers of climate change and how to act against it.

## World Hunger 
> Hunger defines a short-term physical discomfort as a result of chronic food shortage, or in severe cases, a life-threatening lack of food. (National Research Council, 2006)
> 
> World hunger refers to hunger aggregated to the global level. Related terms include food insecurity and malnutrition --worldhumger.org

## Climate change and World Hunger

Climate change and World hunger are closely related to each other.The wired behavior of climate due to climate change plays a vital role in agriculture that's why the production of food is affected and causes world hunger..
### Climates role in World Hunger
1. **Impact in Food production**  Climate change decreases the level of agricultural productivity, which has a direct impact on hunger levels globally.
2. **Impact in Nutrition** Climate variability and extremes can also affect nutrition and food safety in several ways.
3. **Impact on food access**  Extreme climate change effect the prices of food . so the rural poor peoples can't afford food
